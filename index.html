            <li><a href="task2.html">Task 2 - Email</a></li>
        </ul>


        <p>How it works</p>

        <ul>
            <li>IFrame contains a standalone 'app' that is just a basic HTML clickthrough with a tiny bit of control Javascript.</li>
                <li>Importantly because it is just HTML it can be made fully branded, fully responsive, fully accessible and easily translatable.
            </li>
            <li>All the control sits outside of the 'app'.</li>
            <li>The outer frame contains all the instructions and any feedback.</li>
            <li>All instructions are created via a simple config file. <a href="config_email.json">Example file</a></li>

            <li>There are different messages for each step if you do the wrong thing.</li>
            <li>You can toggle highlighting of each</li>
            <li>Note: To get the next instruction you currently need to click or tab out of the field</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Other things we could do with this approach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make fields either fuzzy matches or allowing anything that matches the validation</li>
            <li>Saving to the LRS anything a learner types in</li>
            <li>Put in place tech to easily screenshot all this</li>
        </ul>
