        <h1>LMW Practise Tasks - proof of concept</h1>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="task1.html">Task 1 - Registration</a></li>
            <li><a href="task2.html">Task 2 - Email</a></li>
            <li><a href="task3.html">Task 3 - Replicating the task in the current sending an email course</a></li>
        </ul>


        <p>How it works</p>

        <p>Obviously this POC is rough and ready, and the teaching is terrible(!) but the general idea is that we build a 'dummy' website featuring all the concepts we want to teach, 
            then wrap it with tasks .</p>

        <ul>
            <li>An iframe contains the standalone 'dummy' website that is just a basic HTML clickthrough with a tiny bit of control Javascript.</li>
            <li>Importantly because it is just HTML it can be made fully branded, fully responsive, fully accessible and easily translatable.</li>
            <li>All the instruction sits outside of the 'dummy' website.</li>
            <li>The outer frame contains all the instructions for the task and any feedback.</li>
            <li>All instructions and fields to target are defined in a simple config file. <a href="config_email.json">Example file</a></li>
            <li>Different tasks can use the same app but target different fields.</li>
            <li>There are different messages for each step and different messages if you do the wrong thing.</li>
            <li>You can toggle highlighting of the fields you need to fill to help</li>
            <li>Note: To get the next instruction you currently need to click or tab out of the field</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Other things we could do fairly easily with this approach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make fields either fuzzy matches or allowing anything that matches the validation</li>
            <li>Saving any data a learner types to the LRS</li>
            <li>Put in place a framework to easily screenshot parts of the 'dummy' app for use in learning objects</li>
        </ul>
